A packaging of the Thickbox javascript library for use in Elgg. Allows for easy lightboxes with a simple javascript call of tb_show().

This is a library plugin. This plugin does nothing on its own. This plugin exists so that other plugins may use it to put up easy lightboxes using the thickbox library.
